    about: 'A passionate cybersecurity professional üîê who started with a strong foundation in system and network security, diving deep into the world of vulnerabilities, exploits, and defenses. I began my journey in security operations‚Äîanalyzing threats, triaging incidents, and monitoring systems in real time to keep organizations safe from evolving threats üõ°Ô∏è. Over time, I expanded into offensive security, mastering web and API penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and red team simulations. Using tools like Burp Suite, Nessus, and Wireshark, and scripting with Python ‚öôÔ∏è, I‚Äôve identified critical flaws, bypassed hardened defenses, and helped strengthen overall security posture. My projects span everything from bypassing WAFs üîì to automating threat detection across hybrid environments. Currently pursuing my OSCP and HTB CDSA certifications üìö, I continue to hone both red and blue team skills‚Äîbridging the gap between adversary simulation and proactive defense. My Master\'s in Cybersecurity from the University of Maryland üéì has deepened my understanding of secure architectures, IAM, and incident response methodologies. Whether it\'s protecting cloud infrastructure, dissecting phishing campaigns, or reverse-engineering threats üß†, I bring curiosity, precision, and drive to every engagement‚Äîturning complex problems into practical, secure solutions üöÄ.',
